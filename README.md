# Welcome to Telescope Creator!

This is a web app for the public to learn about space telescopes, by 'building' one themselves! Make sure the cost of your telescope does not exceed your budget!

The web app is hosted on Amazon EC2 [here](http://ec2-54-221-110-95.compute-1.amazonaws.com/).

The development of this web app follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

- Planning and Analysis - Write up a [design requirement document](design_requirement.docx), and use Trello to organize project.
- Design - Use Figma to design mockups, accessible [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hPHpn9HBrmu5F9uhcalZZe/telescopes?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=SSOZiY3Z2OCCLuZt-1).
- Build - Coding phase starts, keep track of progress using Trello, make sure to comment on code.
- Test - Write unit tests with pytest and do manual tests, manage testing using Jira.
- Deployment - Deploy website on Amazon EC2, also tried running the app locally on Docker.
